<!-- badges: end -->

The goal of `hpa.spatial.data` is to contain data for spatial analyses,
just the same as
[{absmapsdata}](https://github.com/wfmackey/absmapsdata) contains data
that can be accessed via
[{strayr}](https://runapp-aus.github.io/strayr/).

## Installation

Don’t bother! This package is not intended to be installed but only to
contain data. An example function to access data from this package is
forthcoming.
