<!-- badges: start -->
[![Lifecycle: experimental](https://img.shields.io/badge/lifecycle-experimental-orange.svg)](https://lifecycle.r-lib.org/articles/stages.html#experimental)
<!-- badges: end -->

The goal of `hpa.spatial.data` is to contain data for spatial analyses, just the 
same as [{absmapsdata}](https://github.com/wfmackey/absmapsdata) contains
data that can be accessed via [{strayr}](https://runapp-aus.github.io/strayr/).

## Installation

Don't bother! This package is not intended to be installed but only to contain
data. An example function to access data from this package is forthcoming.
